## Steps: ##

1. added app.js and added accordion component as it's child. App is passing Items array as props to accordion.
2. Mapped items on <div> using items.map() .
3. add semantic UI css to the index.html link tag.
4. add helper function for click in accordian component. If we write the handler like this:

```javaScript
onClick={onTitleClick(index)}
```

It will be immediately executed on the page load, not on button click. To make it work on btn clk, we write it in arrow function:

```javaScript
onclick={() => onTitleClick(index)}
```
